Approach 1: 
sort and compare O(nlogn)
Approach 2:
count1 = [0]*256
count2 = [0]*256
for i in range(0,len(a)):
  count1[ord[i]] + = 1;
for i in range(0,len(b)):
  count2[ord[i]] + = 1;
# If both strings are of different length. Removing this 
    # condition will make the program fail for strings like 
    # "aaca" and "aca" 
    if len(str1) != len(str2): 
        return 0
  
    # Compare count arrays 
    for i in xrange(NO_OF_CHARS): 
        if count1[i] != count2[i]: 
            return 0
  
    return 1
